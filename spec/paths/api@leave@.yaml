    description:
      If you are creating leave spanning multiple days send the start as midnight of the starting day and finish as midnight at the end of the last day.
      For example, if you are on leave for both the 7th and 8th of April 2020 send the start as "2020-04-07T00:00:00+09:30" and the finish as "2020-04-09T00:00:00+09:30"
      If you are creating a multi-day leave event not starting or finishing at midnight, divide this into multiple full and part day events.
